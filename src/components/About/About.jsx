            <h1>What is programming?
Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand. 

Programming enables so many things in our lives. Here are some examples: 

When you browse a website to find information, contact a service provider, or make a purchase, programming allows you to interact with the site’s on-page elements, such as sign-up or purchase buttons, contact forms, and drop-down menus.

The programming behind a mobile app can make it possible for you to order food, book a rideshare service, track your fitness, access media, and more with ease. 

Programming helps businesses operate more efficiently through different software for file storage and automation and video conferencing tools to connect people globally, among other things. 

Space exploration is made possible through programming.  

How does computer programming work?
At its most basic, programming tells a computer what to do. First, a programmer writes code—a set of letters, numbers, and other characters. Next, a compiler converts each line of code into a language a computer can understand. Then, the computer scans the code and executes it, thereby performing a task or series of tasks. Tasks might include displaying an image on a webpage or changing the font of a section of text. 

Most used programming languages
Different programming languages enable programmers to write code that computers understand. According to a survey by Statista, the top five programming languages that developers use as of June 2022 are: 

JavaScript, used by 65.36 percent 

HTML/CSS, used by 55.08 percent

SQL, used by 49.43 percent 

Python, used by 48.07 percent 

TypeScript, used by 34.83 percent [1]

Explore below what you can do with these programming languages: 

JavaScript
This language is used on every major web browser. JavaScript allows you to add complex features to a web page, such as content updates, interactive maps, and animated graphics, develop games, and more.

HTML/CSS
These languages are used to create web pages and web applications. You would use HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to build web page structure, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) would enable you to determine the page’s styling.

SQL
SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is used to communicate with databases, including updating and retrieving data.

Python
Python programming is most used in machine learning, web development, and desktop applications. Python is a popular language among beginners, as the syntax is relatively easy to learn. It is known as an object-oriented programming language.

TypeScript
TypeScript is a free, open-source programming language developed by Microsoft as a superset of JavaScript. It’s used for developing large applications. What is programming?
